Custodian is a utilitarian and moderation bot designed to make moderating your Discord server easier. It features per server settings and a dashboard to keep track of your servers settings.


<b>Note</b>

I do not give you permission to run the bot yourself in any way, shape, or form. This includes downloading the bot and modifying it slightly, then claiming it as your own or claiming you built the bot yourself. The bot's code is open source to provide examples to others, not to allow you to claim it as your own.

<b>Need help?</b>

You can join the [support server](https://discord.gg/qtpgmFe), and invite the bot using this [link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=379424813170819083&scope=bot&permissions=2105015551).
